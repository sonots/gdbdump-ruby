# gdbdump

Print C level and Ruby level backtrace of living ruby process using gdb

## Installation

```
$ gem install gdbdump
```

## Requirements

* gdb
* linux
* `sudo gdb` must be allowed

It was verfied that gdbdump works with ruby executables built by [rbenv/ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build).

## Usage

```
Usage: gdbdump [options] pid
    -d, --[no-]debug                 print debug log (default: false)
    -x, --gdbinit FILE               path to ruby repo's .gdbinit (default: some of ruby repo's .gdbinit is pre-bundle in this gem)
        --gdb PATH                   path to gdb command (default: gdb)
        --ruby PATH                  path to ruby which the attached process uses (default: get from /proc/[PID]/exe)
```

### .gdbinit

Default supported ruby versions: 2.1.x - 2.4.x

Ruby repo's [.gdbinit](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/.gdbinit) file defines useful helper functions and it is maintained by ruby core team. `gdbdump` uses it.
Some versions written as above of .gdbinit are bundled in this gem, but if you want to use `gdbdump` for older or newer ruby versions:

1. Download .gdbinit from ruby repo like [ruby/2.4.1/.gdbinit](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v2_4_1/.gdbinit), and specify with `-x` option
2. Or, send PR to bundle the .gdbinit in `gdbdump` gem.

## Example

With living ruby 2.4.1 process of pid 1897,

```
$ gdbdump 1897
```

You will see C and Ruby level backtrace as:

```
$1 = (rb_vm_t *) 0x7f46bb071f20
* #<Thread:0x7f46bb0a5ee8 rb_thread_t:0x7f46bb0725d0 native_thread:0x7f46ba514740>
0x7f46ba16d700 <thread_join_m at thread.c:980>:in `join'
loop.rb:17:in `<main>'
* #<Thread:0x7f46bb202750 rb_thread_t:0x7f46bb3e03d0 native_thread:0x7f46b89c0700>
0x7f46ba0e4f30 <rb_f_sleep at process.c:4388>:in `sleep'

* #<Thread:0x7f46bb202660 rb_thread_t:0x7f46bb3e47e0 native_thread:0x7f46b87be700>
0x7f46ba0e4f30 <rb_f_sleep at process.c:4388>:in `sleep'
loop.rb:13:in `block (2 levels) in <main>'
0x7f46ba1a72b0 <rb_f_loop at vm_eval.c:1137>:in `loop'
loop.rb:11:in `block in <main>'
```

## FAQ

* Q. How this work?
  * A. Attach to the ruby process with gdb, and call `rb_ps` defined in gdbinit. That's it.
* Q. Is this available for production process?
  * A. GDB stops the process during printing backtrace, would cause some issues

## Comparisons

* gdb
  * You can print C level backtrace with raw gdb, of course
* [sigdump](https://github.com/frsyuki/sigdump)
  * sigdump enables to print ruby level backtrace with sending CONT signal to living ruby process.
  * The ruby process **must pre-install** `sigdump` gem and `require 'sigdump/setup'` unlike gdbdump.
  * sigdump prints backtrace in signal handler, so blocks main thread, but other threads still work unlike gdbdump.
* [gdbruby](https://github.com/gunyarakun/gdbruby)
  * gdbruby enables to print C level and ruby level backtrace of living ruby process and core file.
  * gdbruby **must follow changes of C level interfaces of CRuby** to get backtrace of the core file, it rises fragility that it will be broken on newer ruby versions.
  * gdbruby stops the process during printing backtrace as gdbdump, but it supports also core file. Using `gcore` command to get core file, it would be possible to analyze without stopping the process.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Investigation

Belows are my investigation notes about how to print C level and Ruby level backtrace via gdb.

#### (1) rb_print_backtrace() and rb_backtrace()

CRuby itself has [rb_print_backtrace](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/26864584d269b6141a27c783cf8b751c067c7dbe/vm_dump.c#L671) function to print C level backtrace, and [rb_backtrace](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/eb59047e2aabb050b23061d513f7b89dc2905670/vm_backtrace.c#L770) function to print Ruby level backtrace.
I first tried to use them.

However, they print a backtrace of only current thread. Furthermore, rb_print_backtrace supports printing outputs to only STDERR.

```ruby
def print_backtrace
  run do |gdb|
    gdb.cmd_exec('call write(2, "== c backtrace ==\n", 18)')
    gdb.cmd_exec('call rb_print_backtrace()')
    gdb.cmd_exec('call write(2, "== ruby backtrace ==\n", 21)')
    gdb.cmd_exec('call rb_backtrace()')
  end
end
```

#### (2) bt and rb_eval_string()

I secondly tried to use GDB's `info threads` and `bt` command to print C level backtrace. This was fine.

I also tried to print Ruby level backtrace by calling [rb_eval_string](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/44396dbe123511678710cfb21223c954b9ceaafb/vm_eval.c#L1474) with Ruby codes as:

```ruby
def ruby_backtrace_code
  code = +%Q[File.open('#{dumpfile}', 'a') {|f|]
  code << %q[
    Thread.list.each {|th|
      f.write %Q[  Thread #{th} status=#{th.status} priority=#{th.priority}\n]
      th.backtrace.each {|bt|
        f.write %Q[      #{bt}\n]
      }
    }
  }]
  code.split("\n").map(&:strip).join('; ')
end

def print_backtrace
  run do |gdb|
    gdb.cmd_exec(%Q[call rb_eval_string("#{ruby_backtrace_code}")])
  end
end
```

However, the debugee (target) process got stuck after `call rb_eval_string`. It seemed the ruby process will be broken if ruby codes are executed via gdb.

#### (3) rb_ps from ruby trunk's .gdbinit

I thirdly tried to use `rb_ps` function defined in [.gdbinit](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/44396dbe123511678710cfb21223c954b9ceaafb/.gdbinit#L983) of ruby repository to print C level and Ruby level backtrace of all threads.

Since `.gdbinit` is maintained by ruby core team, I do not need to follow changes of C level interfaces of CRuby as long as I follow `.gdbinit`.

The drawback of this way is that

1. I have to follow changes of `.gdbinit` in newer ruby versions
2. `rb_ps` takes somewhat long time like 2.6 seconds to print backtrace.

Currently, I am taking this way.
